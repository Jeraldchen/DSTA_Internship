# DSTA_Internship
Node-RED and LoRaWAN Projects done during my internship with DSTA.

I came up with end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for projects done during my 6 months internship with the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) using sensors that makes use of the Long Range Wide Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol. 
Here are some of the JSON code done by me using Node-RED for my projects. 

The ATAK.json file is a project done by researching on the application called Android Tactical Assault Kit (Civilian version) developed by the US Department of Defense and how I can make use of Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
to send latitude and longitude data from an Abeeway Microtracker sensor into the ATAK application itself in real time.
